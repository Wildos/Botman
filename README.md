# Botman

This is a bot I created to handle some dice roll on a Discord server.

It requires 3 environments variables :

**ACTUAL_GM**: the Discord ID* of the GM

**AUTHORIZED_CHANNELS**: an array of all the authorized channels where the bot have to read and write

**TOKEN**: the authentification token of the bot

If you catch an unexpected behaviour, please create an issue.
